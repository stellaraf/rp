# Route Policy

**rp** is supposed to take routing policy "intent" (probably tailored very specifically to [AS14525](https://docs.stellar.tech/docs/interconnection/routing-policy)), device information from [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox), and push valid configurations to routers (probably Juniper routers). We'll see if that's how it ends up.

## Installation

Don't bother, this is nowhere near ready for actual use. Check back later, or watch the repo.
